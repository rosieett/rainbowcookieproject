# rainbowcookieproject

Rainbow cookies have always been my favorite kind of cookie. Mini cake? Petit Fleur? It’s a cookie. Growing up in lower manhattan meant I was never all that far from an italian bakery and I was also lucky enough to be born into the Geller baked good mindset - gotta try everywhere to know which is your favorite. Venieros and Rocco’s were often frequented bakeries, and I’d always get (at least) a rainbow cookie (or a cannoli but they’re for different moods, you know?). I didn’t realize until I left New York City that rainbow cookies are not a nationwide delicacy. My nince years spent living in Seattle and Washington, D.C. meant I was at a loss for rainbow cookies, so when I moved back to NYC mid 2021, one of the first things I did was pop into any bakery as I passed and got a rainbow cookie. I started rating them and posting my thoughts to my instagram story. And thus began the initial thoughts of the rainbow cookie project. I wanted to find the best rainbow cookie in Astoria (and then Queens? And then all of nyc?).
