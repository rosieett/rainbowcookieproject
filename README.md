The Rainbow Cookie Project: A Sweet Exploration of Queens' Best Rainbow Cookies 🍪🌈

The Rainbow Cookie Project is your ultimate guide to finding the best Rainbow Cookies in Queens, New York City! With so many bakeries offering their own version of this iconic treat, we decided to take the guesswork out of the equation. We visited every bakery in Queens that had Rainbow Cookies, conducted a blind taste test, and rated each one based on key factors: the chocolate, almond flavor, cake texture, jam filling, and vibrant color.

To make it even easier for you to find your perfect cookie, we visualized the results—so you can filter through based on your favorite cookie elements, whether you’re all about the cake, the marzipan, or the chocolate.

We had a team of 4 tasters with different preferences, ensuring that the ratings cover a wide range of opinions. Each bakery gets its own profile, so you can learn more about what makes their cookie special. Plus, there’s a handy recommendation page in case we missed any hidden gems in our search!

So whether you're a die-hard fan of the cake, the chocolate, or the jam, the Rainbow Cookie Project has everything you need to satisfy your sweet tooth and find your new favorite spot in Queens. 🍪✨
