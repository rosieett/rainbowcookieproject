                        a dark chocolate coating. The are the quintessential New York Italian-American dessert, largely
                        only available in NYC
                        and neighboring New York towns. The cake layers are colored to align to the Italian flag, but
                        sometimes vary for
                        different occasions.</p>

                            end of Queens but the most north was Ditmars Ave; east: 51st street.</p>

                        <p class="background-paraText"><span class="bold"> June 1, 2024: </span>I walked 5.24 miles,
                            stopping at every bakery on the list (below) and purchased “two rainbow cookies.” I marked
                            the bakery bag with a number, corresponding to the list of bakeries I created to remember
                            which cookie came from which bakery, noted the cost, and kept walking to the next.</p>

                        <p class="background-paraText">It took me 2.5 hours and $37.55.</p>

                        <p class="background-paraText">I then weighed and photographed each set of cookies, and assigned
                            new numbers so I could also be tasting them as blind as the other tasters.</p>

                        <p class="background-paraText"> I invited my sister, Mattie, my friend Tracy, and my husband,
                            Ken, to be the first round of blind taste testers. Each cookie sat next to it’s assigned
                            kind-of-random number between 1 and 13.</p>

                        <p class="background-paraText">They were cut into smaller pieces and as a group, we went one
                            cookie at a time. A piece was eaten and the scores were documented.</p>

                        <p class="background-paraText">There was some discussion but overall, we generally kept our
                            thoughts to the score card.</p>

                        <p class="background-paraText">There was also saltines, carrots and celery, and unsalted

                    <p>
                        Rosie and Adri are star-crossed design soul mates who met clandestinely through working as
                        graphics
                        reporters on the
                        same team at the Wall Street Journal. They regularly match each other’s silliness - including,
                        but not
                        limited to making
                        entire websites
                        about cookies, love for pets, food, and their shared colleague-turned-bestie, Danny (who also
                        taught Rosie
                        d3).
                    </p>
                    <p>Rosie is a born and raised New Yorker and loves rainbow cookies maybe a little too much. Rosie
                        thought up
                        the
                        concept of the project and all that comes with it, coded it, and ate a lot of cookies.

                    </p>
                    <p>Adri has never had a rainbow cookie but loves to design them. Adri took Rosie's horrible mock ups
                        and made it the beauty you see before you. She also figured out the UX
                        design for the project.</p>
